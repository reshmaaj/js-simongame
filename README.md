## What I Learned

During this project, Iâ€™ve effectively learned and implemented:

- âœ… jQuery for DOM manipulation and event handling.
- âœ… Playing custom audio on events (`.mp3` sounds).
- âœ… Dynamic class manipulation (`.addClass()` and `.removeClass()`).
- âœ… Generating random patterns using JavaScript logic.
- âœ… Building a game loop with user interaction.
- âœ… Animations using jQuery's `.fadeIn()` / `.fadeOut()` and `.addClass()`.
- âœ… Resetting game states when the user fails.
- âœ… Clean, responsive HTML/CSS layout.
