## What I Learned

During this project, I’ve effectively learned and implemented:

- jQuery for DOM manipulation and event handling.
- Playing custom audio on events (`.mp3` sounds).
- Dynamic class manipulation (`.addClass()` and `.removeClass()`).
- Generating random patterns using JavaScript logic.
- Building a game loop with user interaction.
- Animations using jQuery's `.fadeIn()` / `.fadeOut()` and `.addClass()`.
- Resetting game states when the user fails.
- Clean, responsive HTML/CSS layout.
